# Workflow Comparison for TaskFlow

## Current: GitHub Flow
- Single main branch
- Feature branches for all changes  
- PRs for everything
- Deploy from main

## Alternative 1: Git Flow
Pros:
- Clear separation of development/production
- Dedicated release preparation

Cons:
- More complex for small team
- Slower feature delivery

## Alternative 2: Trunk-based Development
Pros:
- Very fast iteration
- Minimal branching

Cons:
- Requires excellent CI/CD
- Higher risk without feature flags

## Recommendation
Stick with GitHub Flow because:
1. Team size is small (< 10 developers)
2. We deploy frequently
3. Simple model reduces errors
